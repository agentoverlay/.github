# AgentOverlay

**AgentOverlay** is a next-generation enterprise platform that delivers a trusted policy and observability layer for AI agent systemsâ€”without requiring changes to your existing code or infrastructure.

As organizations begin to deploy autonomous agents across critical workflows, AgentOverlay ensures those agents operate securely, transparently, and in full compliance with enterprise and regulatory requirements.

## ðŸ§  What is AgentOverlay?

AgentOverlay provides a **non-intrusive control plane** for agent communication, identity, and policy enforcement. It is:

- **Framework-agnostic**: Compatible with all major agent protocols including MCP, A2A, and others.
- **Infrastructure-agnostic**: Seamlessly integrates with AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and more.
- **Network-native**: Applies policy and security at the protocol levelâ€”similar to a service mesh or firewall, but built for AI agents.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Policy Enforcement**  
  Define and enforce dynamic, role-based policies for agent communication and behavior.

- **Agent Discovery & Trust Registry**  
  Find, verify, and collaborate with trusted agents across organizational boundaries.

- **Observability & Monitoring**  
  Track agent decisions, interactions, and compliance events with full audit visibility.

- **Secure Overlay Architecture**  
  Agents connect via a virtual mesh, enabling zero-trust communication and enforcement without modifying your existing agent logic.

- **Identity & Access Control**  
  Built-in identity resolution and access control for agents, services, and users.

## âœ… Why AgentOverlay?

Deploying AI agents at scale introduces a new class of operational and security challenges:

| Problem | AgentOverlay Solution |
|--------|------------------------|
| Lack of runtime governance | Policy-enforced communication and observability |
| Siloed agent networks | Decentralized trust and discovery layer |
| Vendor lock-in | Open protocol support and infrastructure-agnostic |
| Compliance risk | Transparent audit logs and real-time monitoring |
